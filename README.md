## This is a simple java code to extract all the variable names from another java file and renames with your friends names(if you wish ðŸ˜†).

This is built because this will be used for my upcoming projects :) Hence feel free to modify or suggest changes

ðŸš¨ This parser might contain bugs because the code is assumed as a string and everything at the end is based on string operations. Hence test well before you use this.
